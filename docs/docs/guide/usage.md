# Usage

## Enabling AVInfo Columns

After installing the extension, audio and video information for media files can be previewed in columns via the GNOME Files _List View_. The columns can be activated by navigating to _View Options -> Visible Columns_ and enabling the relevant columns.

These are the columns that are currently supported.

```
Duration, Dimensions, Frame Rate, Total Bit Rate, Audio Bit Rate, Video Bit Rate
```

## Refreshing Thumbnails

Thumbnails for certain media files can be forcibly regenerated by selecting the _Refresh Thumbnail_ option in the right-click context menu. After regenerating the thumbnail, you will need to refresh GNOME Files (`Ctrl + R`) for the updated thumbnail to appear.
